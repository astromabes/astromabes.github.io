I am currently a graduate student in the Astronomy Department at the University of Texas at Austin. With [Prof. John Chisholm](https://www.chisholmjohn.com), I study the nebular properties of galaxies across redshifts, to probe the formation and evolution of early galaxies. These properties include physical conditions, ionization mechanisms and structure, and chemical abundances. I make use of optical and IR spectra from ground- and space-based observatories, including JWST. I aim to study how each of these properties evolve over cosmic time using deep, high-resolution spectroscopy.

I earned my B.S. in Physics with a concentration in Astronomy at the University of West Georgia, where I worked with Prof. Nick Sterling and focused on the nebular properties, specifically chemical abundances, of Galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae to study the production of s-process neutron-capture elements and how they can be used to probe the chemical evolution of galaxies.
